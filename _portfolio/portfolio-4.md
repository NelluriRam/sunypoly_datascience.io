title: "Research Project 4: Extract Hidden Program Rules"
excerpt: "Programs often follow implicit programming rules, such as, function call A must be followed by function call B. Nevertheless, programming rules play an important role in software testing and maintenance. For example, the rules can be used as test oracles to detect violations. If a programmer can be notified of these rules before updating the source code, the chances of generating defects due to rule violations might be minimized."

There are many implicit programming rules in a large softwareâ€“ some are simple and some are complex. For example, the function call pair of lock and unlock is a simple programming rule. A complex rule can involve a list of function call and system call sequence. Prior works have used static and dynamic analysis techniques to extract implicit programming rules, but none compares the effectiveness of the two techniques. We have undertaken an empirical study to compare the two techniques when they are being used for extracting programming rules.

title: "Research Project 1: Automated Reproduction of System-Level Concurrency Bugs"
excerpt: "Reproducing System-Level Concurrency failures is hard because (1) concurrency failures at the system level often involve multiple processes or event handlers (e.g., software signals), which cannot be handled by existing tools for reproducing intra-process (thread-level) failures; (2) detailed field data, such as user input, file content and interleaving schedule, may not be available to developers; and (3) the debugging environment may differ from the deployed environment, which further complicates failure reproduction. To address these problems, we develped automated teqniques to reproduce system-level concurrency bugs (i) by using the default console logs of an application and  (ii) by using the bug reports."

To develop automated bug reproduction technique just by using the default connsole logs of an application, we uses a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques,together with symbolic execution (FSE 2017).
Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Static and Dynamic Analysis of Source Code and Information Rertieval techniques are used to develop bug reproduction of system-level concurrency bugs from bug reports. Once developers receive a bug report, an important and often the first step is to reproduce the failure. However, this is challenging primarily because the provided information in bug reports is often unstructured and written in natural language, which can be ambiguous and incomplete. Even we assume the developers perfectly understand the bug report, the actual reproduction can be challenging since a concurrent program can behave differently in a similar environment for each execution. We proposes a practical bug reproduction tool to help developers reproduce concurrency failures and localize the cause of the failure in specific application functions by using only bug reports.

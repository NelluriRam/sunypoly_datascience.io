title: "Research Project 1: Automated Reproduction of System-Level Concurrency Bugs by using the default consol logs"
excerpt: "Reproducing System-Level Concurrency failures is hard because (1) concurrency failures at the system level often involve multiple processes or event handlers (e.g., software signals), which cannot be handled by existing tools for reproducing intra-process (thread-level) failures; (2) detailed field data, such as user input, file content and interleaving schedule, may not be available to developers; and (3) the debugging environment may differ from the deployed environment, which further complicates failure reproduction. To address these problems, we develped automated teqniques to reproduce system-level concurrency bugs by using the default console logs of an application"

To develop automated bug reproduction technique just by using the default connsole logs of an application, we uses a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques,together with symbolic execution. When concurrency failures occur in a deployed system, developers often have to diagnose them in a different (debugging) environment to identify the root causes. Toward this end, an important step is to reproduce the failure in a timely manner. However, this is challenging due to the limited data generated by production runs. Typically, field data are transferred from customers to developers. However, if they belong to different organizations, customers may not be willing to share their inputs and file contents involved in the failed execution. Thus, for the purpose of reproducing failures in production runs, we have to assume that the only available field data are default log messages generated by the unmodified application. Under this assumption, we proposes the first fully automated tool for reproducing failures using only default logs collected from the field(FSE 2017).

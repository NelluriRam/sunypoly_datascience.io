title: "Research Project 6: Towards an User Interactive Debugging Technique"
excerpt: "Many Automated debug-ging  techniques  are  developed  and  proposed  by  researchers.   However,  there  is  noresearch  on  the  real-world  usage  of  these  techniques. To  develop  an  user  friendlydebugging technique we set up research questions for developers.  The answers willshow the path to develop an user-interactive debugging technique."

To develop automated bug reproduction technique just by using the default connsole logs of an application, we uses a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques,together with symbolic execution. When concurrency failures occur in a deployed system, developers often have to diagnose them in a different (debugging) environment to identify the root causes. Toward this end, an important step is to reproduce the failure in a timely manner. However, this is challenging due to the limited data generated by production runs. Typically, field data are transferred from customers to developers. However, if they belong to different organizations, customers may not be willing to share their inputs and file contents involved in the failed execution. Thus, for the purpose of reproducing failures in production runs, we have to assume that the only available field data are default log messages generated by the unmodified application. Under this assumption, we proposes the first fully automated tool for reproducing failures using only default logs collected from the field(FSE 2017).

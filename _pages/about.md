I am actively looking for a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor Position in the field of Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Information Systems.

About Me
======

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Kentucky. My advisor is Dr. Tingting Yu. I received my MS. and BSc. in the Department of Computer Science, the University of Dhaka in 2013 and 2011 respectively.


Research Interest
======
I am interested in techniques that make computer systems more autonomous, efficient, reliable, and user-friendly. In my current research works, I used Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Discovery, Information Retrieval, and Program Analysis to make the concurrent software systems autonomous.
